## GeminiGuard: Cooperative Defense against Adversarial Attacks

This is repository for paper GeminiGuard: Cooperative Defense against Adversarial Attacks

### Requirements
we mainly require the Python=3.6, keras=2.1.3, tensorflow-gpu=1.12.0, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn,cv2.
Detailed packages are shown in requirements.yaml

### Structure
The "json" directory contains the config files of all experiments.
The generated adversarial examples are saved in "adversarial" directory.
We save all the trained model in "model" directory.
The "data" directory is used for saving dataset.


User guide needs to be finished To be finish 

### Quick Usage
The weights of model are provided.
You can follow the following steps to generate the adversarial examples and detect them.




### Training models from the scratch
We provide the detail scripts to train the classifier and regulator.
